Agile=> iterative and incremental process of the deliver the project in the IT companies. 

product life cycle=> requirement process=> designing=> developing=> testing=> delivering => support and maintenance.


these cycle are repeated until the project completion and in a each cycle new feature will be added through out the completion of the project.


advantages of agile methodologies:)

1. Customer don't have to wait for the deliverables. (every 2/3 week customer get the piece of software)
2. requirements can be changed at any part of the time.
3. Team members easily can be communicated.(product owner, dev team, qa team, scrum master )


Agile Principles:)

1. Customer Satisfaction => less waiting time.
2. Collabrative work.
3. Develop, test, deploy with every few weeks. 


SCRUM :) 

Scrum is the framework used to develop software product by doing agile process.

SCRUM Team :) Product Owner, Dev Team, QA Team, SCRUM Master.

PO=> defines the product features, to proritize the list of features. he can accept/ reject the status of the job.

SCRUM Master:) => Drives the agile principle. 

Sprint => It is a particular duration of time user can complete the stories/task.
(2-3 weeks) normally.

Sprint Planning meeting => What are user stories would have to delivered will be discussed in this meeting.

SCRUM Meeting=> standup meeting=> (yesterday completion, todays agenda, problem faced during the work/project)

Product owner => will take the requirement from customers/stake holders/client and list the priority of the tasks in the product backlog.(it contains the list of user stories).

Sprint planning meeting => Discuss about the stories might have completed within particular sprint. (no of user stories).

Sprint backlog=> no of committed stories are available here.

Sprint Period Starts=> normally this is 1-4 weeks of time.

24 hrs one standup call => started by SCRUM Master.


After completing one sprint => Sprint Reveiew will be there. (Demo to PO).

After that sprint retrospecting meet will be there. => analysing the peroformance of last sprint (what went well, waht went wrong)
